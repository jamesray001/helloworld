        <h1>Some of my other interests include..</h1>
            <section title="other-interests">
                <h2>TV Shows</h2>
                <p id="interests-text">I really enjoyed <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> when I was young and the show holds up great even today. I was able to share it with my son, Cooper, who also 
                    enjoyed it immensely. Some of my other favorite shows include <em>Game of Thrones</em> and <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>.</p>

                <h2>Traveling</h2>
                <p id="interests-text">I have had the incredible opportunity to travel to some pretty exotic places in my life including Australia, China, Greece, Italy, Costa Rica, just to name a few. 
                    These were great life experiences that I think helped me round out the person who I am today. Some day I'd really love to go visit Japan.</p>
